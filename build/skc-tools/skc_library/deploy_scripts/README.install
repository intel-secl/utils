Pre-requisite for the SKC Library Deployment
==========================================
 - SGX Enabled in BIOS
 - RHEL 8.2 OS

RHEL8 package Requirements
==========================
Following RHEL 8 repositories should be setup and available (/etc/yum.repos.d) to download and resolve SKC package dependencies
	BaseOS
	AppStream
	CodeReady
- Ensure that dnf update can download and install latest software updates

- If there are kernel updates updates avaiable, please install them and reboot the machine, so that SGX driver can build against proper kernel

- Ensure CMS/AAS/KBS server/VM IP addresses are added to the no_proxy environment variable.
	Also ensure the KBS VM hostname is added to the no_proxy list

- Ensure that the system date is properly setup to same date/time(PDT time) on all machines/VMs where SKC components are being installed
	This is important, else certificate verifications will fail

How to Deploy
==============
- Please ensure the SGX Agent is already deployed first  on the same machine, where SKC Library is being deployed. for SGX Agent deployment instructions,
  refer to sgx_agent/deploy_scripts/README.install

- To verify the checksum of the SKC Library tar file and extract
# ./skclib_untar.sh

# cd  skc_library
- Update the IP Address for CSP/Enterprise VM and Enterprise VM hostname in skc_library.conf

- To deploy SKC Library on a SGX Enabled Server,
# ./deploy_skc_library.sh

To test Secure key transfer of a key from KBS to the nginx, please follow the below mentioned steps.
1. On the enterprise VM:
	edit skc-tools/kbs_scripts/run.sh, change the KMS_IP and AAS_IP with the ip address where these services are running, save and close
2. ./run.sh reg
3. copy the crt file generated to the SGX server /root/ directory where skc_library is deployed
4. On the SGX Server :
	a. create a file /tmp/keys.txt and add PKCS11 url as below:
		 pkcs11:token=KMS;id=4fa20b5a-ef7e-4cba-ab51-f778656d65a3;object=RSAKEY;type=private;pin-value=1234
		 replace the id with the id printed as output of step 2
	b. edit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file add same id in ssl_certificate_key. also add crt file location which was copied in step 3. save and close
	c. open /opt/skc/etc/pkcs11-apimodule.ini file and following line under [core] section
		preload_keys=/tmp/keys.txt. save and close
	d. systemctl restart nginx
		This will fetch the key from KBS to enclave loaded by nginx
	e. wget -k -v https://localhost:2443 --no-check-certificate
		This will use key stored inside enclave for SSL Handshake and download index.html from nginx
