Pre-requisite for the SKC Library build system
==============================================

RHEL8 package Requirements
==========================
- Following RHEL 8 repositories should be setup and available (/etc/yum.repos.d) to download and resolve SKC_Library package dependencies
	BaseOS
	AppStream
	CodeReady
- Ensure that dnf update can download and install latest software updates
	If dnf update installs new kernel, make sure to restart the build vm for the new kernel to take effect
- dnf install git
- Ensure that the system date is properly setup (to PDT time)

How to Build
=============
- To build SKC Library, 
# ./skc_library_build.sh
- This script will generate a tarball(skc_library.tar) and checksum file(skc_library.sha2)
- Copy skc_library.tar, skc_library.sha2 and untar.sh(from skc_library directory) to a directory in the deployment machine
