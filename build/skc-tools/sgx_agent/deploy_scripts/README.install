	BaseOS
	AppStream
	CodeReady
- Ensure that dnf update can download and install latest software updates

- Ensure CMS/AAS/SHVS server/VM IP addresses are added to the no_proxy environment variable

- Turn off Firewall service or ensure that the SHVS system can access the machine where SGX Agent is running
# systemctl stop firewalld

	To find CMS_TLA_SHA run following command on the machine where CMS is installed
	# cms tlscertsha384

- To deploy SKC Agent on a SGX Enabled Server, run deploy_sgx_agent.sh
# ./deploy_sgx_agent.sh

Contents of the Deployment Tar file
===================================
- Deployment scripts:deploy_sgx_agent.sh sgx_agent_create_roles.sh and deployment_prerequisites.sh
- Pre-filled agent.conf
- Download binaries/rpms/libraries in bin directory.
