Pre-requisite for the SGX Agent Deployment
==========================================
 - SGX and FLC Enabled in BIOS
 - RHEL 8.4 or Ubuntu 20.04

RHEL8 package Requirements
==========================
Following RHEL 8 repositories should be setup and available (/etc/yum.repos.d) to download and resolve SKC package dependencies
	BaseOS
	AppStream
	CodeReady
- Ensure CSP side server/VM IP addresses are added to the no_proxy environment variable

- Turn off Firewall service or ensure that the SHVS system can access the machine where SGX Agent is running
# systemctl stop firewalld

- Ensure that the system date is properly setup (to PDT time) on all machines/VMs where SKC components are being installed
	This is important, else certificate verifications will fail
