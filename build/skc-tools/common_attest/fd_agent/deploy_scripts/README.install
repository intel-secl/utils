Pre-requisite for the FD Agent Deployment
==========================================
 - SGX and FLC Enabled in BIOS
 - RHEL 8.2/8.4 OS

RHEL8 package Requirements
==========================
Following RHEL 8 repositories should be setup and available (/etc/yum.repos.d) to download and resolve SKC package dependencies
	BaseOS
	AppStream
	CodeReady
- Ensure CSP side server/VM IP addresses are added to the no_proxy environment variable

- Turn off Firewall service or ensure that the FDS system can access the machine where FD Agent is running
# systemctl stop firewalld

- Ensure that the system date is properly setup (to PDT time) on all machines/VMs where SKC components are being installed
	This is important, else certificate verifications will fail

How to Deploy
==============
- To verify the checksum of the FD Agent Deployment tar file and extract it
# ./fd_agent_untar.sh

# cd fd_agent
- Update the SGX Server IP Addresses, FD Agent user credentials and CMS_TLS_SHA value in fdagent.conf
	To find CMS_TLA_SHA run following command on the machine where CMS is installed
	# cms tlscertsha384

- To deploy FD Agent on a SGX Enabled Server, run deploy_fd_agent.sh
# ./deploy_fd_agent.sh

Contents of the Deployment Tar file
===================================
- Deployment scripts:deploy_fd_agent.sh create_roles.sh and deployment_prerequisites.sh
- Pre-filled fdagent.conf
- Binaries/rpms/libraries in bin directory.

Repo Contents
=============
deploy_fd_agent.sh		Main script for Deploying FD Agent on SGX enabled server
