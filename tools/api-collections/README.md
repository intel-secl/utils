| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Foundational Security  | Host Attestation(RHEL & VMWARE)                              | ✔️                  |
|                        | Data Fencing  with Asset Tags(RHEL & VMWARE)                 | ✔️                  |
|                        | Trusted Workload Placement (VM & Containers)  | ✔️ |
| Launch Time Protection | VM Confidentiality                            | ✔️                  |
|                        | Container Confidentiality with CRIO Runtime   | ✔️                  |
| SGX Attestation Infra & Secure Key Caching | Secure Key Caching | ✔️ |
|  | SGX Discovery & Provisioning | ✔️ |

> **Note: ** `Foundational Security - Host Attestation` is a pre-requisite for all usecases beyond Host Attestation. E.g: For working with `Launch Time Protection - VM Confidentiality` , Host Attestation flow must be run as a pre-req before trying VM Confidentiality
