# SGX Agent Simulator

`SGX Agent Simulator` is primarily involved in SGX technology discovery and collection of SGX attributes on a SGX enabled platform (Single Socket/Multi socket).

## Key features

- SGX agent required for SGX Discovery and Provisioning
- SGX agent simulator required for registering dummy host as per host count in env file.
- Collects the SGX platform-specific values, explicitly Encrypted PPID, CPU SVN, ISV SVN, PCE ID, Manifest and QEID
- SGX Agent Simulator provides dummy platform SGX-related information to the SGX Host Verification Service

## System Requirements

- RHEL 8.2
- Epel 8 Repo
- Proxy settings if applicable
- SHVS should be up and running

## Software requirements

- git
- makeself
- docker
- Go 1.16.7

# Step By Step Build Instructions

## Install required shell commands

### Install tools from `dnf`

```{.shell}
sudo dnf install -y git wget makeself docker
```

### Install `go 1.16.7`

The `Certificate Management Service` requires Go version 1.14 that has support for `go modules`. The build was validated with version 1.16.7 version of `go`. It is recommended that you use a newer version of `go`

- but please keep in mind that the product has been validated with 1.16.7 and newer versions of `go` may introduce compatibility issues. You can use the following to install `go`.

```{.shell}
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.16.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf go1.16.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv go /usr/local
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$PATH
```

## Build SGX Agent Simulator

- Git clone the SGX Agent Simulator and generate binary
- Run scripts to build the SGX Agent

```{.shell}
git clone https://github.com/intel-secl/utils.git && cd utils
git checkout v4.1/develop
cd tools/skc-simulators/sgx_agent_simulator/sgx_agent_simulator_automation/build_scripts/

- To build SGX Agent Simulator,
#./sgxagent_build.sh
- This script will generate a tarball(sgx_agent.tar) and checksum file(sgx_agent.sha2)
- Copy sgx_agent.tar, sgx_agent.sha2 and agent_untar.sh(from sgx_agent directory) to a directory in the deployment machine
- run agent_untar.sh to untar sgx_agent.tar
#./agent_untar.sh
- update HOST_COUNT in env file.
- update agent.conf
- update HOST_START_ID and HOST_COUNT in sgx_agent.env
HOST_START_ID=<start id of agent greater than zero>
HOST_COUNT=<number of host to register in agent>
- To deploy SGX Agent Simulator
#./deploy_sgx_agent.sh.
```
