Requirements
------------

This role requires the following as pre-requisites:

1. **Build Machine and Ansible Server**<br>
   
   - The Build machine is required to build Intel® SecL-DC repositories. More details on building repositories in [Quick Start Guide - Foundational & Workload Security](https://github.com/intel-secl/docs/blob/master/quick-start-guides/Quick%20Start%20Guide%20-%20Intel%C2%AE%20Security%20Libraries%20-%20Foundational%20%26%20Workload%20Security.md) and in [Quick Start Guide - Secure Key Caching](https://github.com/intel-secl/docs/blob/master/quick-start-guides/Quick%20Start%20Guide%20-%20Intel%C2%AE%20Security%20Libraries%20-%20Secure%20Key%20Caching.md)
   - The Ansible Server is required to use this role to deploy Intel® SecL-DC services based on the supported deployment   model. The Ansible server is recommended to be installed on the Build machine itself. 
   - The role has been tested with `Ansible Version 2.9.10`
   
2. **Repositories and OS**<br>

   * **Foundational and Workload Security Usecases**
     * `RHEL 8.3` OS
     * Repositories to be enabled are `rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms` and `rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms`<br>
   * **Secure Key Caching**
     * `RHEL 8.2` OS / `Ubuntu 18.04` OS
     * Repositories to be enabled for RHEL OS are `rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms` and `rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms` and `codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms`<br>

3. **User Access**<br>
   Ansible should be able to talk to the remote machines using the `root` user and the Intel® SecL-DC services need to be installed as `root` user as well<br>

4. **Physical Server Requirements**<br>

   a. **Foundational and Workload Security Usecases**
      * Intel® SecL-DC supports and uses a variety of Intel security features, but there are some key requirements to consider before beginning an installation. Most important among these is the Root of Trust configuration. This involves deciding what combination of TXT, Boot Guard, tboot, and UEFI Secure Boot to enable on platforms that will be attested using Intel® SecL.

        > **Note:** At least one "Static Root of Trust" mechanism must be used (TXT and/or BtG). For Legacy BIOS systems, tboot must be used. For UEFI mode systems, UEFI SecureBoot must be used* Use the chart below for a guide to acceptable configuration options.Only dTPM is supported on Intel® SecL-DC platform hardware.  

        ![hardware-options](./images/trusted-boot-options.PNG)

        > **Note:** A security bug related to UEFI Secure Boot and Grub2 modules has resulted in some modules required by tboot to not be available on RedHat 8 UEFI systems. Tboot therefore cannot be used currently on RedHat 8. A future tboot release is expected to resolve this dependency issue and restore support for UEFI mode.

   b. **Secure Key Caching, SGX Attestation Kubernetes, SGX Attestation Openstack, SGX Orchestration Kubernetes, SGX Orchestration Openstack and Skc No Orchestration Usecases**
      * Supported Hardware: Intel® Xeon® SP products those support SGX
      * BIOS Requirements: Intel® SGX-TEM BIOS requirements are outlined in the latest Intel® SGX Platforms BIOS Writer's Guide, Intel® SGX should be enabled in BIOS menu (Intel® SGX is Disabled by default on Ice Lake), Intel® SGX BIOS requirements include exposing Flexible Launch Control menu.
      * OS Requirements (Intel® SGX does not supported on 32-bit OS): Linux RHEL 8.2 / Linux Ubuntu 18.04<br>

Example Inventory and Vars
--------------------------

In order to deploy Intel® SecL-DC binaries, the following inventory can be used and the required inventory vars as below need to be set. The below example inventory can be created under `/etc/ansible/hosts`

On RHEL:
```
[CSP]
<machine1_ip/hostname>

[Enterprise]
<machine2_ip/hostname>

[Node]
<machine3_ip/hostname>

[CSP:vars]
isecl_role=csp
ansible_user=root
ansible_password=<password>

[Enterprise:vars]
isecl_role=enterprise
ansible_user=root
ansible_password=<password>

[Node:vars]
isecl_role=node
ansible_user=root
ansible_password=<password>
```

On Ubuntu:
```
[CSP]
<machine1_ip/hostname>

[Enterprise]
<machine2_ip/hostname>

[Node]
<machine3_ip/hostname>

[CSP:vars]
isecl_role=csp
ansible_user=<ubuntu_user>
ansible_password=<password>

[Enterprise:vars]
isecl_role=enterprise
ansible_user=<ubuntu_user>
ansible_password=<password>

[Node:vars]
isecl_role=node
ansible_user=<ubuntu_user>
ansible_password=<password>
```

> **Note:** Ansible requires `ssh` and `root` user access to remote machines. The following command can be used to ensure ansible can connect to remote machines with host key check `
  ```shell
  ssh-keyscan -H <ip_address/hostname> >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts
  ```

Using the Role in Ansible
-------------------------

The role can be cloned locally from git and the contents can be copied to the roles folder used by your ansible server <br>

```shell
#Create directory for using ansible deployment
mkdir -p /root/intel-secl/deploy/

#Clone the repository
cd /root/intel-secl/deploy/ && git clone https://github.com/intel-secl/utils.git

#Checkout to specific release version
cd utils/
git checkout <release-version of choice>
cd tools/ansible-role

#Update `roles_path` under `ansible.cfg` to point to /root/intel-secl/deploy/utils/tools/
```



Example Playbook and CLI
------------------------

The following are playbook and CLI example for deploying Intel® SecL-DC binaries based on the supported deployment models and usecases. The below example playbooks can be created as `site-bin-isecl.yml`

> **Note:** If running behind a proxy, update the proxy variables under `vars/main.yml` and run as below

> **Note:** Go through the `Additional Examples and Tips` section for specific workflow samples

Playbook

```yaml
- hosts: all
  any_errors_fatal: true
  gather_facts: yes
  vars:
    setup: <setup var from supported usecases>
    binaries_path: <path where built binaries are copied to>
  roles:   
  - ansible-role
  environment:
    http_proxy: "{{http_proxy}}"
    https_proxy: "{{https_proxy}}"
    no_proxy: "{{no_proxy}}"
```

and

```shell
ansible-playbook <playbook-name>
```

> **Note:** Update the `roles_path` under `ansible.cfg` to point to the cloned repository so that the role can be read by Ansible


or (skip `vars` from above playbook and provide using CLI of ansible)

Playbook

```yaml
- hosts: all
  any_errors_fatal: true 
  gather_facts: yes
  roles:   
  - ansible-role
  environment:
    http_proxy: "{{http_proxy}}"
    https_proxy: "{{https_proxy}}"
    no_proxy: "{{no_proxy}}"
```

and

```shell (on RHEL)
ansible-playbook <playbook-name> --extra-vars setup=<setup var from supported usecases> --extra-vars binaries_path=<path where built binaries are copied to>
```

```shell (on Ubuntu)
ansible-playbook <playbook-name> --extra-vars setup=<setup var from supported usecases> --extra-vars binaries_path=<path where built binaries are copied to> --extra-vars "ansible_sudo_pass=<password>"
```

> **Note:** Update the `roles_path` under `ansible.cfg` to point to the cloned repository so that the role can be read by Ansible


Additional Workflow Examples
----------------------------

#### TPM is already owned

If the Trusted Platform Module(TPM) is already owned, the owner secret(SRK) can be provided directly during runtime in the playbook:

```shell
ansible-playbook <playbook-name> \
--extra-vars setup=<setup var from supported usecases> \
--extra-vars binaries_path=<path where built binaries are copied to> \
--extra-vars tpm_secret=<tpm owner secret>
```
or

Update the following vars in `vars/main.yml`

```yaml
# The TPM Storage Root Key(SRK) Password to be used if TPM is already owned
tpm_owner_secret: <tpm_secret>
```

#### UEFI SecureBoot enabled

If UEFI mode and UEFI SecureBoot feature is enabled, the following option can be used to during runtime in the playbook

```shell
